Weather Forecast Application (Using Python)

Project Overview:

The Weather Forecast Application is a Python-based command-line program that fetches real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. It uses public weather APIs to convert a city name into geographical coordinates and then retrieves current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

This project also demonstrates the secure use of environment variables to protect API URLs, making it suitable for real-world applications and GitHub hosting.

Features:

i.Fetches real-time weather data for any city
ii.Converts city names into latitude and longitude
iii.Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition
iv.Uses environment variables to hide API URLs
v.Clean and user-friendly console output
vi.Beginner-friendly and well-structured code

Technologies & Libraries Used:

1.Python 3
2.requests – for API requests
3.python-dotenv – for loading environment variables
4.os – for accessing environment variables

How It Works:

a.The program takes a city name as input.
b.The city name is converted into latitude and longitude using a geocoding API.
c.The weather API fetches current weather data using these coordinates.
d.The program extracts temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather code.
e.A simple mapping converts weather codes into readable conditions.
f.Weather details are displayed in a clean format.
