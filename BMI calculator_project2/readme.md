BMI Calculator (Using Python)

Project Overview:

The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a Python-based command-line application that calculates a user’s BMI using their weight and height. It also categorizes the result into standard health classifications such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese.

This project demonstrates proper input handling, mathematical calculations, and exception handling in Python, making it ideal for beginners.

Features:

i.Calculates BMI using standard formula
ii.Accepts user input for weight and height
iii.Displays BMI rounded to two decimal places
iv.Categorizes BMI into health ranges
v.Handles invalid inputs gracefully using exception handling

Technologies Used:

1.Python 3
2.Built-in exception handling (try-except)

How It Works:

a.The program takes weight and height as user input.
b.It checks if the height is greater than zero.
c.BMI is calculated using the formula:
BMI = weight / (height²)
d.The calculated BMI is rounded to two decimal places.
e.Based on the BMI value, the program assigns a health category.
f.Errors like invalid input or zero height are handled using try-except blocks.
