Project Overview:

The Random Password Generator is a Python-based console application designed to generate strong, secure, and customizable passwords. It allows users to choose the password length and the type of characters to include, making it useful for improving account security and understanding basic Python concepts like user input, loops, and standard libraries.

Letters only
Digits only
Symbols only
Combination of letters, digits, and symbols

iii.Random and secure password generation.

iv.Simple and interactive command-line interface.

1.The program takes the password length as input from the user.
2.It asks the user to select a password type.
3.Based on the selected option, a character set is chosen using the string module.
